   Planning Poker is a way of collaboratively deciding how much work each required task will take your team to complete.
   
   Each game gives a chance for every member of the team to vote on the amount of work a task will take; the manager then has the ability to set and send final estimates in the Requirement Manager. This allows a team to easily rank and distribute their requirements appropriately.
